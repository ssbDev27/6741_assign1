Comprehensive Examination and Research Proposal (6 credits),PHYS,870,"The purpose of this course is to satisfy the department that the student is sufficiently prepared, in terms of background and ability, to pursue the research required for a PhD. Each student is required to prepare a written project in his/her field of research. The topic is general, and not part of the thesis work. The oral examination is based on the contents of this report. The Graduate Program Committee appoints an examination committee in consultation with the thesis supervisor. The supervisor is responsible for the subject chosen and also acts as a member of the examining committee for the oral presentation. The comprehensive examination must be completed within four months after the candidate's initial registration in the PhD program. The grade for this course is a Pass or Fail. In case of failure in the first attempt, only one more attempt is allowed to take place.",https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/phys-phd.html
Doctoral Research and Thesis (69 credits),PHYS,890,"A student who has passed the comprehensive examination is admitted to candidacy for the PhD degree. The student is allowed to continue working on a research project under the direction of a faculty member of the department only after passing the comprehensive examination. The research is in areas which reflect the interests of the faculty and the facilities of the department. The thesis must make a distinct and original contribution to knowledge, and be presented in acceptable literary form.",https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/phys-phd.html
